# NodeApp


> Create, delete & edit.

 It’s a CRUD web application in which I’ve also added Google Oauth using “passport”, “sessions”, “cookies” and “handlebars” as my template engine. I’ve used MongoDB, to store the users, posts, and sessions. So there’s a lot of things going through this application.

This app uses Node.js/Express/MongoDB with Google OAuth for authentication

## Usage

Add your mongoDB URI and Google OAuth credentials to the config.env file

```
# Install dependencies

# Run in develpment
